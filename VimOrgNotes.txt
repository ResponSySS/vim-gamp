*SUMMARY*

Lightweight plugin for full function completion using Linux manual and GTags (not mandatory).


*DETAILED DESC*

GAMP is a very lightweight completion system for libc functions and virtually any other functions.

REQUIREMENTS
  Mandatory:
    * Linux-like OS with a shell and a manpage system
    * Vim 'laststatus' must be set to 2
  Optional:
    * GNU Global (its use can be disabled)

FEATURES
  * 3 modes:
    * Complete function prototype in completion mode
    * Hint for function prototype in statusline mode
    * Do all of the above when using both modes
  * Take definition from all the function manpages from section 2 and 3
    ( system and library (including libc) calls )
  * Take definition of any function using GNU Global GTags system
  * If not using Global GTags, there is no dependency
  * Real-time updating and no maintenance required if using  gtags.vim  
    auto-update feature

USAGE EXAMPLE
In completion mode:
        printf ||                       /* "||" is the cursor */
    After pressing <Leader>gmc  becomes:
        print|f| ( {+const_char_pt_format+}, {+VA_Args+} )
    Use <C-j> to jump to next argument:
        printf ( ||, {+VA_Args+} )
        printf ( "GAMP mark: %d/10"||, {+VA_Args+} )
    And again:
        printf ( "GAMP mark: %d/10", || )
        printf ( "GAMP mark: %d/10", 10|| )

In statusline mode:
        printf (const char *format, ...)
     Is displayed on statusline.

NOTES
  * Functions taking function pointers as arguments are not yet fully supported

*INSTALL DETAILS*

Inside the GAMP.tar archive are two files that you have to put in the appropriate location of your vim folder (for me, it's  $HOME/.vim ).
You can do it using your graphical archive manager (like  file-roller ), or with the command-line with
    $ tar -xvf  GAMP.tar
to extract the archive, and:
    $ cp  doc/gtags-and-man-proto.txt      $HOME/.vim/doc
    $ cp  plugin/gtags-and-man-proto.vim   $HOME/.vim/plugin 
to copy the files.
